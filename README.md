# PBK test and demonstration models

The aim of this repository is to maintain a collection simple PBK model implementations in Antimony demonstrating how different modelling choices that are possible can be translated to PBK model implementations in Antimony. For example, variants for modelling of different exposure routes. For this, a simple base PBK model is used, for which variations are collected demonstrating specific modelling concepts. Besides demonstrating how different modelling aspects translate to implementations in Antimony, the models in this repository are translated to SBML and annotated to align with established FAIR PBK guidelines.
