  # Parameters

  ## Physiology

  ### Body size
  BW = 70            # body weight [kg]
  VRc = 0.9003       # rest-of-body volume as fraction body weight [L/kg]
  VLc = 0.0257       # liver volume as fraction of body weight [L/kg]
  VBc = 0.074        # blood volume as fraction of body weight [L/kg]

  ### Flow rates
  QCC = 15           # cardiac output as function of body weight [L/h/kg^0.75]
  QRc = 0.773        # fraction of blood flow to rest-of-body [-]
  QLc = 0.227        # fraction of blood flow to liver [-]

  ## Biochemical parameters

  #### Partition coefficients
  PCLiver = 2        # partition coefficient liver:blood [-]
  PCRest = 1.2       # partition coefficient rest:blood [-]

  #### Metabolism and excretion
  CLUrine = 1        # urinary excretion rate [L/h]

  #### Absorption
  Ka = 0.05          # absorption rate from gut to liver [/h]

  # Assignments

  ## Physiology

  ### Flow rates
  const QC := QCC * BW^0.75 # cardiac output adjusted for body weight [L/h] 
  const QL := QC * QLc     # blood flow to liver [L/h]
  const QR := QC * QRc     # blood flow to rest-of-body [L/h]

  # Compartments
  compartment Blood := BW * VBc
  compartment Liver := BW * VLc
  compartment Rest := BW * VRc
  compartment Gut
  compartment Urine

  # Species
  substanceOnly species ABlood in Blood
  substanceOnly species ALiver in Liver
  substanceOnly species ARest in Rest
  substanceOnly species AGut in Gut
  substanceOnly species AUrine in Urine

  # Initial values
  ABlood = 0
  ALiver = 0
  ARest = 0
  AGut = 0
  AUrine = 0

  # Model equations

  ## Absorption
  AGut -> ALiver; AGut * Ka

  ## Distribution
  ABlood -> ALiver; QL * ABlood / Blood
  ALiver -> ABlood; QL * (ALiver / Liver) / PCLiver
  ABlood -> ARest; QR * ABlood / Blood
  ARest -> ABlood; QR * (ARest / Rest) / PCRest

  ## Excretion
  ABlood -> AUrine; ABlood / Blood * CLUrine
