# Simple inhalation model

Simple PBK model modelling the inhalation exposure route via alveolar air. This modelling of the inhalation route is similar to that of the EuroMix PBK model by Tebby et al. (2020).

## Considerations

* In this model, the alveolar air compartment explicitly models the alveolar air, which is only part of the total air in the lungs.
* The alveolar ventilation rate of 2220 L/h seems to be very high. Yet, this is the same as used in the EuroMix PBK model by Tebby et al. (2020), which was based on Brown et al. (1997).
